"""Multi-player game agent implementation.

This module provides the base agent class for multi-player games, supporting:
    - Variable number of players
    - Role-based player configurations
    - Phase-based game flow
    - Information hiding between players
    - Concurrent or sequential player actions

    >>> from haive_agents.agent_games.framework.multi_player.agent import MultiPlayerGameAgent
    >>> 
    >>> class ChessAgent(MultiPlayerGameAgent[ChessState]):
    ...     def __init__(self, config: ChessConfig):
