"""State management interface for multi-player games.

This module provides the base state manager interface for multi-player games,
defining the core operations that game-specific state managers must implement.
The state manager handles:
    - Game initialization
    - Move application and validation
    - Legal move generation
    - Game status updates
    - Phase transitions
    - Information hiding

Example:
    >>> from typing import List, Dict, Any
    >>> from haive_agents.agent_games.framework.multi_player.state_manager import MultiPlayerGameStateManager
    >>> 
    >>> class MyGameStateManager(MultiPlayerGameStateManager[MyGameState]):
    ...     @classmethod
    ...     def initialize(cls, player_names: List[str], **kwargs) -> MyGameState:
    ...         return MyGameState(players=player_names)
"""

    This abstract base class defines the interface for managing game states
