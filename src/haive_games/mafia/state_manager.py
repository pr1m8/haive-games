"""State management for the Mafia game.

This module provides the core state management functionality for the Mafia game,
handling game state transitions, move validation, and game progression logic.

The state manager is responsible for:
    - Game initialization and setup
    - Phase transitions (day/night cycles)
    - Move validation and application
    - Game state filtering for information hiding
    - Win condition checking

Example:
    >>> from mafia.state_manager import MafiaStateManager
    >>> 
    >>> # Initialize a new game
    >>> players = ["Player_1", "Player_2", "Player_3", "Narrator"]
    >>> state = MafiaStateManager.initialize(players)
    >>> 
    >>> # Apply a move
    >>> move = MafiaAction(
    ...     player_id="Player_1",
    ...     action_type=ActionType.VOTE,
    ...     target_id="Player_2",
    ...     phase=GamePhase.DAY_VOTING,
    ...     round_number=1
    ... )
    >>> new_state = MafiaStateManager.apply_move(state, "Player_1", move)

    This class extends MultiPlayerGameStateManager to provide Mafia-specific
    state management functionality. It handles game progression, move validation,

    The manager maintains game state including:
        - Player roles and alive/dead status

        - Vote tracking and resolution
        - Night action resolution (kills, saves, investigations)
