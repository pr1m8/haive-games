"""Base state management for multi-player games.

This module provides the foundational state model for multi-player games,
supporting features like:
    - Player tracking and turn management
    - Game phase transitions
    - Move history recording
    - Public and private state management
    - Error handling

Examples:
    >>> from haive.agents.agent_games.framework.multi_player.state import MultiPlayerGameState
    >>>
    >>> # Create a game state
    >>> state = MultiPlayerGameState(
    ...     players=["player1", "player2", "player3"],
    ...     game_phase=GamePhase.SETUP
    ... )
    >>>
    >>> # Advance to next player
    >>> next_player = state.advance_player()

    This class provides the foundation for managing game state in multi-player

        players (List[str]): List of player names/IDs.
        current_player_idx (int): Index of current player in players list.
        game_phase (str): Current phase of the game (see GamePhase enum).
        game_status (str): Status of the game (e.g., "ongoing", "ended").
        move_history (List[Dict[str, Any]]): History of all moves made.
        round_number (int): Current round number.
        player_data (Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]]): Private data for each player.
        public_state (Dict[str, Any]): Public game state visible to all.
        error_message (Optional[str]): Error message if any.
