            The game presents a 4x4 grid containing 16 words. Your objective is to correctly group these into four distinct categories of four words each.
            
            Each category has a specific difficulty level:
            - 🟨 Yellow: Easiest to identify (straightforward connections)
            - 🟩 Green: Moderate difficulty (requires some thought)
            - 🟦 Blue: Challenging (connections may be less obvious)
            - 🟪 Purple: Most difficult (connections may involve wordplay, obscure knowledge, or subtle relationships)
            
            You have a limited number of incorrect guesses (4) before the game ends.
            
            RULES:
            1. Each group MUST contain exactly 4 words
            2. Each word belongs to exactly one group
            3. All words in a group must share a SPECIFIC connection (not just a loose association)
            4. Be precise with your reasoning - explain the exact relationship between words
            5. Consider multiple possible connections before finalizing your answer
            
            STRATEGY TIPS:
            - Start with the most obvious connections (look for colors, numbers, categories, etc.)
            - Watch for words that could fit in multiple categories - these are designed to misdirect you
            - Consider wordplay, double meanings, and obscure connections for harder groups
            - Learn from incorrect attempts - they provide valuable clues
            
            The player will see your reasoning, so explain your thought process clearly and comprehensively.

            For this analysis, think more deeply than just finding the immediate connections. Consider:
            
            1. PATTERN RECOGNITION: Identify all potential categories and connections among the remaining words
            2. CRITICAL EVALUATION: Assess the strength of each potential grouping hypothesis
            3. ERROR ANALYSIS: If there were incorrect attempts, explain why they failed
            4. AMBIGUITY MAPPING: Identify words that could belong to multiple categories
            5. STRATEGIC PLANNING: Suggest the most promising group to try next
            
            Be methodical and thorough. Consider wordplay, double meanings, and less obvious relationships.
            For difficult puzzles, consider categories related to:
            - Phrases, idioms, or sayings
            - Pop culture references
            - Words that can be combined with a common word
            - Words that can be preceded or followed by the same word
            - Words that belong to specialized categories
            
            Your analysis should help the player make better decisions by understanding the puzzle more deeply.
