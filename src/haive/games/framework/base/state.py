"""Base state module for game agents.

This module provides the foundational state class for game agents,
defining the core state attributes that all games need to track.

Example:
    >>> state = GameState(
    ...     turn="player1",
    ...     game_status="ongoing",
    ...     move_history=[]
    ... )

Typical usage:
    - Inherit from GameState to create game-specific state classes
    - Use as the state schema in game configurations
    - Track game progress and history
