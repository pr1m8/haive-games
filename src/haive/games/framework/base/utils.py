"""Utility functions for game agents.

This module provides utility functions for running and managing game agents,
including game execution and state visualization.

Example:
    >>> agent = ChessAgent(config)
    >>> run_game(agent)  # Run a new game
    >>> run_game(agent, initial_state=saved_state)  # Continue from a saved state

Typical usage:
    - Use run_game to execute a complete game with an agent
    - Provide optional initial state to continue from a specific point
    - Monitor game progress through visualization and status updates

def run_game(agent: "GameAgent", initial_state: dict[str, Any] | None = None):
    """Run a complete game with the given agent.

    This function executes a game from start to finish using the provided agent.
    It handles game initialization, move execution, state visualization, and
    error reporting. The game can optionally start from a provided initial state.

    Args:
        agent (GameAgent): The game agent to run the game with.
        initial_state (Optional[Dict[str, Any]], optional): Initial game state.
            If not provided, a new game will be initialized. Defaults to None.

    Example:
        >>> agent = ChessAgent(ChessConfig())
        >>> # Start a new game
        >>> run_game(agent)
        >>>
        >>> # Continue from a saved state
        >>> run_game(agent, saved_state)

    Note:
        - The function will print game progress to the console
        - Game visualization depends on the agent's visualize_state method
        - Game history will be saved using the agent's save_state_history method
