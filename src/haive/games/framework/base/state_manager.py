"""Base state manager module for game agents.

This module provides the foundational state manager class that handles
game state transitions and operations. It defines the interface that all
game-specific state managers should implement.

Example:
    >>> class ChessStateManager(GameStateManager[ChessMove]):
    ...     @classmethod
    ...     def initialize(cls) -> ChessState:
    ...         return ChessState.new_game()
    ...
    ...     @classmethod
    ...     def apply_move(cls, state: ChessState, move: ChessMove) -> ChessState:
    ...         return state.apply_move(move)

Typical usage:
    - Inherit from GameStateManager to create game-specific state managers
    - Implement the required methods for state initialization and transitions
    - Use in conjunction with game agents to manage game flow
