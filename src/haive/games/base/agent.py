"""Base game agent module.

This module provides the foundational GameAgent class that implements common workflow patterns
for game-specific agents. It handles game initialization, move generation, position analysis,
and game flow control.

Example:
    >>> class ChessAgent(GameAgent[ChessConfig]):
    ...     def __init__(self, config: ChessConfig):
    ...         super().__init__(config)
    ...         self.state_manager = ChessStateManager

Typical usage:
    - Inherit from GameAgent to create game-specific agents
    - Override necessary methods like prepare_move_context and extract_move
    - Use the setup_workflow method to customize the game flow
