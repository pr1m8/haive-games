"""Base framework for game agents.

This package provides the foundational classes and utilities for building game agents,
including experimental features for game development.

Core Components:
    - GameAgent: Base class for implementing game-specific agents
    - GameConfig: Configuration class for game agents
    - GameState: Base state representation for games
    - GameStateManager: Interface for managing game state transitions
    - GameAgentFactory: Factory for creating game agents

Experimental Components:
    - GameTemplateGenerator: Template generator for creating new game implementations
      Warning: This component is experimental and its API may change.

Example:
    >>> from haive_agents.agent_games.framework.base import GameAgent, GameConfig
    >>> from haive_agents.agent_games.framework.base import GameTemplateGenerator  # Experimental
