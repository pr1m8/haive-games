"""Game state models for the Mafia game.

This module defines the core state model for the Mafia game, extending the
base MultiPlayerGameState with Mafia-specific functionality.

The state model tracks:
    - Player roles and statuses
    - Game phase and progression
    - Voting and action history
    - Public announcements
    - Night action outcomes

Example:
    >>> from mafia.state import MafiaGameState
    >>> from mafia.models import PlayerRole, GamePhase
    >>>
    >>> # Create a new game state
    >>> state = MafiaGameState(
    ...     players=["Player_1", "Player_2", "Narratof"],
    ...     roles={"Player_1": PlayerRole.VILLAGER,
    ...            "Player_2": PlayerRole.MAFIA,
    ...            "Narrator": PlayerRole.NARRATOR},
    ...     game_phase=GamePhase.SETUP
    ... )
