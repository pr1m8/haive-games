"""LLM engine configurations for the Mafia game.

This module defines the LLM configurations and prompts for each role in the
Mafia game. It provides:
    - Role-specific prompt templates
    - LLM configurations for each role
    - Structured output schemas for decisions
    - Example prompts and responses

The module uses Azure OpenAI's GPT-4 model for all roles, with custom
prompts designed to elicit appropriate role-playing behavior.

Example:
    >>> from mafia.engines import aug_llm_configs
    >>>
    >>> # Get the villager player engine config
    >>> villager_config = aug_llm_configs["villager"]["player"]
    >>> print(villager_config.name)  # Shows "villager_player"
