"""Models for the Mafia game implementation.

This module defines the core data models and enums used in the Mafia game, including:
    - Game phases (setup, night, day discussion, voting)
    - Player roles (villager, mafia, detective, doctor, narrator)
    - Action types (speak, vote, kill, investigate, save)
    - State tracking for players and game
    - Decision models for LLM output

Examples:
    >>> from mafia.models import PlayerRole, GamePhase, MafiaAction
    >>>
    >>> # Create a player action
    >>> action = MafiaAction(
    ...     player_id="Player_1",
