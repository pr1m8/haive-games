"""Mafia game agent implementation.

This module provides the core agent implementation for the Mafia game,
handling:
    - Game initialization and setup
    - Player turn management
    - Move generation and validation
    - Game state visualization
    - Role-specific behavior

The agent uses LLMs to generate player decisions and narrator actions,
creating an engaging and strategic game experience.

Example:
    >>> from mafia.agent import MafiaAgent
    >>> from mafia.config import MafiaAgentConfig
    >>>
    >>> # Create and initialize agent
    >>> config = MafiaAgentConfig.default_config(player_count=7)
    >>> agent = MafiaAgent(config)
    >>>
    >>> # Run the game
    >>> for state in agent.app.stream(initial_state):
    ...     agent.visualize_state(state)
