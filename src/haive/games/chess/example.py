"""Example chess game runner.

This module provides an example of how to run a complete chess game
using the Haive chess module, demonstrating:
    - Agent configuration
    - State initialization
    - Game streaming
    - Event monitoring

This is intended as a basic demonstration of the chess module's capabilities
and can be used as a starting point for more complex implementations.

    """Run a complete chess game with LLM players.

    Creates and runs a chess game between two LLM players, streaming
    the game events and tracking the game status until completion.

    Args:
        thread_id (str, optional): Unique identifier for the game thread.
            If not provided, a random ID will be generated. Defaults to None.

    Returns:
        None: The function outputs game progress to the console.

    Examples:
        >>> # Run a game with a random thread ID
        >>> run_chess_game()

        >>> # Run a game with a specific thread ID
        >>> run_chess_game("chess_custom_id")

    Note:
        This function will run a full chess game with the following configuration:
        - Both white and black players powered by LLMs
        - Position analysis enabled
        - Maximum 200 moves before forcing a draw
        - Streaming output of game events

    The function handles errors gracefully and reports the final game result.
