"""Chess game state manager module.

This module provides state management functionality for chess games, including:
    - Game state initialization
    - Move application and validation
    - Game status tracking
    - Captured pieces management

The state manager offers a clean interface for modifying chess game states
without having to manipulate the state directly.

Example:
    >>> from haive.games.chess import ChessGameStateManager
    >>>
    >>> # Initialize a new game state
    >>> state = ChessGameStateManager.initialize()
    >>>
    >>> # Apply a move
    >>> new_state = ChessGameStateManager.apply_move(state, "e2e4")

from haive.games.chess.state import ChessState


class ChessGameStateManager:
    """Chess game state manager.

    This class provides static methods for managing chess game states:
        - Game initialization with default settings
        - Move application with validation
        - Game status updates
        - Captured pieces tracking

    The manager implements a functional approach where methods take the current
    state and return a new state, rather than modifying the state in place.

    Examples:
        >>> state = ChessGameStateManager.initialize()
        >>> print(state.board_fen)
        'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1'

        >>> new_state = ChessGameStateManager.apply_move(state, "e2e4")
        >>> print(new_state.board_fen)
        'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3 0 1'
