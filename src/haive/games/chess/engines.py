"""Chess game engines using AugLLMConfig.

This module provides LLM engine configurations for chess game agents, including:
    - Player engines for white and black
    - Analyzer engines for position evaluation
    - Prompt templates with chess-specific instructions
    - Structured output models for moves and analysis

The engines use different LLM configurations optimized for their specific roles,
with prompt templates designed to generate high-quality chess moves and analysis.
