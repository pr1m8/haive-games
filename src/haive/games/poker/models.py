"""Core data models for the Poker game implementation.

This module defines the fundamental data structures and models used in the poker game,
including:
    - Card suits and values
    - Hand rankings and game phases
    - Player actions and states
    - Game state tracking
    - Decision models for LLM output

The models use Pydantic for validation and serialization, ensuring type safety
and consistent data structures throughout the game.

Examples:
    >>> from poker.models import Card, Suit, CardValue
    >>>
    >>> # Create a card
    >>> ace_of_spades = Card(suit=Suit.SPADES, value=CardValue.ACE)
