"""Texas Hold'em Poker game state management.

This module implements the core state management for a Texas Hold'em poker game,
including:
    - Game initialization and progression
    - Player action handling
    - Betting rounds and pot management
    - Hand evaluation and showdown logic
    - Side pot creation for all-in situations

The state management is built on top of LangGraph for AI agent integration,
using Pydantic models for type safety and validation.

Example:
    >>> from poker.state import PokerState
    >>> 
    >>> # Initialize a new game
    >>> state = PokerState()
    >>> state.initialize_game(["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"], starting_chips=1000)
    >>> state.start_new_hand()
