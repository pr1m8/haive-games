## Game Features

### Standardized Interface

```python
from haive.games import ChessGame

# All games share common interface
game = ChessGame()
state = game.reset()

while not game.is_terminal():
    actions = game.get_legal_actions()
    action = agent.select_action(state, actions)
    state, reward, done = game.step(action)
```

### Multi-Agent Support

```python
from haive.games import PokerGame

game = PokerGame(num_players=4)
game.add_agent(agent1, position=0)
game.add_agent(agent2, position=1)
game.add_agent(human_player, position=2)
game.add_agent(agent3, position=3)

results = game.play_full_game()
```

### Visualization

```python
# Built-in visualization for all games
game.render()  # Console output
game.render_gui()  # Graphical interface
game.save_replay("game_replay.json")
```

### Metrics & Analysis

```python
from haive.games.metrics import GameAnalyzer

analyzer = GameAnalyzer(game)
stats = analyzer.analyze_game()
# Returns: win rate, average score, decision time, etc.
```

## Agent Development

### Basic Game Agent

```python
from haive.games.base import GameAgent

class MyChessAgent(GameAgent):
    def select_action(self, state, legal_actions):
        # Your strategy here
        return self.evaluate_best_move(state, legal_actions)
```

### Learning Agents

```python
from haive.games.learners import RLGameAgent

# Reinforcement learning agent
agent = RLGameAgent(
    game_type="chess",
    algorithm="ppo",
    training_episodes=10000
)
```

### Tournament System

```python
from haive.games.tournament import Tournament

tournament = Tournament(
    game="poker",
    participants=[agent1, agent2, agent3, agent4],
    rounds=100
)

results = tournament.run()
```

## Benchmarking

### Performance Metrics

- **Win Rate**: Against various opponents
- **ELO Rating**: Skill level estimation
- **Decision Time**: Speed of play
- **Strategy Diversity**: Move variety
- **Learning Curve**: Improvement over time

### Leaderboards

```python
from haive.games.leaderboard import GlobalLeaderboard

leaderboard = GlobalLeaderboard("chess")
leaderboard.submit_agent(your_agent)
ranking = leaderboard.get_ranking()
```

## Advanced Features

### Game Variants

```python
# Many games support variants
game = ChessGame(variant="chess960")  # Fischer Random
game = PokerGame(variant="omaha")
game = CheckersGame(variant="international")
```

### Difficulty Scaling

```python
# Adaptive difficulty
game = SudokuGame(difficulty="adaptive")
game.adjust_to_player_skill(agent)
```

### State Serialization

```python
# Save and restore game states
state = game.get_state()
saved_state = game.serialize_state()

# Later...
game.load_state(saved_state)
```

### Parallel Games

```python
from haive.games import ParallelGameRunner

runner = ParallelGameRunner()
results = runner.run_many([
    (ChessGame(), agent1, agent2),
    (GoGame(), agent3, agent4),
    (PokerGame(), [agent5, agent6, agent7])
])
```

from haive.games.chess import ChessGame
game = ChessGame()

# Play with your agent
from haive.agents import SimpleAgent
agent = SimpleAgent()

game.play_against(agent)
```
